## Project Description
The "Rock-Paper-Scissor Randomizer" is a strategic card game that enhances the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors concept. Players aim to reduce their opponent's health points using cards that feature standard Rock, Paper, or Scissors symbols, often augmented with diverse power-ups.
These power-ups introduce significant strategic depth by offering various unique effects that impact gameplay, making each round more dynamic and unpredictable

## How To Play
Firts player will need to input the username to start the game. After that player can start the game, and player will be redirected to the waiting room to wait for their opponent.

## Game Mechanics
In each round, every player will receive cards to play with. The cards consist of the usual rock-paper-scissors symbols, and sometimes each card can hold special effects or power-ups. For example, the player can get a card that reduces damage taken even when they're on the losing side of the rock-paper-scissors battle, or another example, the player can get a card that could counter the other player's attack damage by a set amount of damage
